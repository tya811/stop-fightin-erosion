harbours will be safer 
inlets will be safer 
seaweed lives longer and spreads further which is better for trees and animals and doesn't just pile up on the beach
sea tutrtle nests will have a greater chance at survival
man of war will not have such a propensity to be so packed in near the beach
every animal ever in the universe is confused by sand on the beach.

currents will be more predictable, as will boating, 
animals will have shelter

waves will be better, longer, more consistent and punchier
